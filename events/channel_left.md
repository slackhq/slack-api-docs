# channel_left event type

	{
		"type": "channel_left",
		"channel": "C024BE91L"
	}

The `channel_left` event is sent to all connections for a user when that user
leaves a channel. Clients should respond to this message by closing the
channel - this means that when a channel is left from client A, it will
automatically be closed in client B.

In addition to this message, all existing members of the channel will receive a
[`channel_leave` message event](/events/message/channel_leave).
