The `name` parameter indicates the name of the channel, without a leading hash
sign.

`creator` is the user ID of the member that created this channel. `created` is
a unix timestamp.

`is_archived` will be true if the channel is archived.

`is_general` will be true if this channel is the "general" channel that
includes all regular team members. In most teams this is called `#general` but
some teams have renamed it.

`members` is a list of user ids for all users in this channel. This
includes any disabled accounts that were in this channel when they were
disabled.

`topic` and `purpose` provide information about the channel topic and purpose.

`is_member` will be true if the calling member is part of the channel.

Some API methods (such as [channels.join](/methods/channels.join)) will
include extra state information for channels when the calling user is a
member. `last_read` is the timestamp for the last message the calling user has
read in this channel. `unread_count` is a full count of visible messages that the 
calling user has yet to read. `unread_count_display` is a count of messages that
the calling user has yet to read that matter to them (this means it excludes things
like join/leave messages). `latest` is the latest message in the channel.
